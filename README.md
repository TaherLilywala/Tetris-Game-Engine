# Tetris Game Engine

To test the lexer you can do the following,
```
python3 lexer.py
```

This will allow you to input test statements which will be scanned by our lexer. A few examples are shown below.
```
Tetris > IF(SPEED == 5): PASS
Tetris > myVar = 10
Tetris > list = []     
```
Use Ctrl + C to exit the program.

NOTE: SLY requires the use of Python 3.6 or greater.  Older versions of Python are not supported.
